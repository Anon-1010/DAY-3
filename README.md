# DAY-3
This repository contains the Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Preprocessing project, where I tackled the essential step of transforming raw, messy data into a clean and usable format. This process ensures that the data is ready for accurate analysis and building robust machine learning models.

# **Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Project**

## **Introduction**

The **Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Project** aims to clean and preprocess the life expectancy dataset for building predictive models. The dataset contains various factors influencing life expectancy across different countries. This project focuses on data cleaning, handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

This project is ideal for understanding data preprocessing techniques and preparing data for machine learning models.

## **Technologies Used**

**Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and preprocessing.

**Libraries**:  
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.  
- **seaborn** and **matplotlib**: For data visualization.  
- **sklearn**: For data imputation and preprocessing.

## **Steps Involved**

### **Step 1: Importing Libraries**

We begin by importing essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` for data manipulation and visualization.

### **Step 2: Reading the Dataset**

The life expectancy dataset is loaded using the `read_csv` function from `pandas`.

### **Step 3: Sanity Check of the Dataset**

- **Shape**: Displays the dimensions of the dataset.
- **Info**: Provides an overview of the datasetâ€™s columns and types.
- **Missing Values**: We calculate and visualize the percentage of missing values in the dataset.
- **Duplicates**: We identify and count duplicate rows to ensure data quality.

### **Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Overview of statistical summaries for numerical columns.
- **Object Columns**: Summary statistics for non-numeric columns.
- **Visualizations**:
    - **Histograms**: For visualizing the distribution of numerical data.
    - **Boxplots**: To detect outliers in numerical data.
    - **Scatterplots**: To explore relationships between the target variable (`Life expectancy`) and independent variables.
    - **Heatmap**: To explore correlations between variables.

### **Step 5: Missing Value Treatment**

- **For Categorical Variables**: Missing values are filled with the mode.
- **For Numerical Variables**: Missing values are treated using the **Median** or **KNN Imputer** to fill the gaps.

### **Step 6: Outlier Treatment**

- **Outliers**: Detected in numerical columns using boxplots. We apply techniques to handle extreme values in the dataset.

### **Step 7: Duplicate Value Treatment**

- **Duplicates**: Duplicate rows are identified and removed to ensure data quality.

### **Step 8: Encoding Categorical Data**

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical variables such as **Country** and **Status** are converted into numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.

### **Step 9: Data Ready for Modeling**

Once preprocessing steps are completed, the dataset is ready for machine learning modeling.

## **Features**

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and duplicates.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed data visualizations and identified patterns and correlations.
- **Outlier and Missing Value Treatment**: Used median, mode, and KNN imputer for handling missing data.
- **Encoding**: Categorical variables were successfully converted into numerical format for model training.

## **Insights**

- **Missing Values**: After imputation, all missing values were handled successfully.
- **Outliers**: Detected and treated extreme values in the numerical columns.
- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables were successfully converted into numerical format for model training.

## **Next Steps**

The cleaned and preprocessed dataset is now ready to be used for building predictive models, such as regression or classification models, to predict life expectancy based on the available features.
