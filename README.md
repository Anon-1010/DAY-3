# DAY-3
This repository contains the Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Preprocessing project, where I tackled the essential step of transforming raw, messy data into a clean and usable format. This process ensures that the data is ready for accurate analysis and building robust machine learning models.

🚀 Project Highlights
🧹 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values using Median Imputation and KNN Imputer.
Detected and removed duplicate rows.
Treated outliers in numerical features to improve data quality.
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data distributions with histograms and boxplots.
Explored relationships between features using scatterplots.
Used heatmaps to understand correlations.
🔄 Feature Engineering
Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding for machine learning compatibility.
📊 Visualizations
Tools and Techniques:
Histograms: Show data distribution.
Scatterplots: Identify relationships between variables.
Boxplots: Detect outliers.
Heatmaps: Highlight correlations between features.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Visualization tools.
Scikit-learn: Used for imputation and preprocessing tasks.
