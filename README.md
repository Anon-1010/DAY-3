# DAY-3
This repository contains the Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Preprocessing project, where I tackled the essential step of transforming raw, messy data into a clean and usable format. This process ensures that the data is ready for accurate analysis and building robust machine learning models.

Introduction
The Life Expectancy Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing global life expectancy data alongside socio-economic and health factors. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to explore patterns and relationships within the data.

This project aims to answer critical questions such as:

How do socio-economic and health factors affect life expectancy?
What correlations can we find between life expectancy and factors like GDP, education, and healthcare?
What are the differences in life expectancy across countries and regions?
This project is ideal for understanding life expectancy trends and factors influencing health outcomes globally.

Technologies Used
Python: Core language for data analysis and visualization.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
numpy: For numerical analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizations.
scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and imputation.
Features
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values using median imputation and KNN imputer.
Detected and removed duplicate rows to improve dataset quality.
Treated outliers in numerical features to ensure clean data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of life expectancy and other variables using histograms and boxplots.
Explored relationships between life expectancy and key socio-economic factors through scatter plots.
Analyzed correlations between various features using heatmaps.
Feature Engineering:

Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables (e.g., country, status) for machine learning compatibility.
Visualizations
Histograms: Show the distribution of life expectancy and other key numerical features.
Scatterplots: Explore relationships between life expectancy and socio-economic factors like GDP, schooling, and healthcare expenditure.
Boxplots: Detect outliers in numerical features such as GDP, population, and healthcare factors.
Heatmaps: Visualize correlations between different features, helping to identify significant relationships.
Insights
Life Expectancy Trends: Life expectancy tends to be higher in developed countries, with notable differences across regions.
Key Correlations: Features like GDP, schooling, and income composition of resources show strong correlations with life expectancy.
Data Imputation: Median and KNN imputation techniques effectively handled missing data, ensuring dataset integrity.
Outlier Detection: Identified and treated outliers to improve the quality and accuracy of predictions.
